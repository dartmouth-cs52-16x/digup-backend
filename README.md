# DigUp

**DigUp** is Dartmouthâ€™s first lost and found listing website designed to help users recover lost items. Over our time at Dartmouth, many of us have personally experienced or witnessed those around us lose expensive, often devastatingly personal, articles including jackets, car keys, and bikes. Based off the necessity and the goodwill of student hearts here at Dartmouth, our team plans to create a web application that expedites the lost&found process and return lost items in an efficient and organized fashion, all the while preserving anonymity (if desired). With the implementation of DigUp within the Dartmouth sphere, victims of forgetfulness seeking aid and those looking to complete their one good deed for the day are now able to integrate their objectives with the benefits going to both parties. Especially with the hectic influx of incoming freshman, outgoing seniors, and in between off-termers, our website would ameliorate the stress and reduce the anxiety of accidentally losing a valuable heirloom during the vulnerable transitioning phase and provide all students with a sense of ease knowing that DigUp is working around the clock to watch their backs.
